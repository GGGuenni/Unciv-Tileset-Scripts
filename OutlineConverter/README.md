# OutlineConverter
The OutlineConverter script was developed for the [AbsoluteUnits Tileset](https://github.com/letstalkaboutdune/AbsoluteUnits) to convert the black outline of a unit sprite to a colored average of its surrounding pixels. The nation color sprites for a sprite are modified too to make the outline nation color sensitive.
A number of settings can be changed inside the script.

### Installation

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary python packages or install them manually before running the script
Packages needed to run: 
`pillow`
